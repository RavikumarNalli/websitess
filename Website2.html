    <b>Srinivasa
        Ramanujan</b><sup>[a]</sup><p>(22 December 1887-26 April 1920) was an Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician">mathematician</a>. Though he had almost no formal training in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics">pure mathematics</a>, he emade substantial contributions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theoryhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series">mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">continued fractions</a>, including solutions to mathematical problems them considered unsolvable.</p>
        <p>Ramanujan intially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Eysenck">Hans Eysenck,</a>"he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work but failed for the most jpart.  What he had to show thej was too novel, too unfamiliar, and aditionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".<sup>[4]</sup> Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail">mail</a>correspondence with the English mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy">G.H.Hardy </a>at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Srinivasa_Ramanujan-Add._MS_a94_version2.jpg/330px-Srinivasa_Ramanujan-Add._MS_a94_version2.jpg" height="200" width="300">University_of_Cambridge of Cambridge,</a>England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem">theroems</a>including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",<sup>[5]</sup> and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</p>
